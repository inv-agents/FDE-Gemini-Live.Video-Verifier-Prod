# Optimized Requirements for Better Performance
# This is an OPTIONAL upgrade path for even better performance

# Computer Vision (optimized versions)
opencv-python-headless==4.8.1.78
pytesseract>=0.3.10
numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0
Pillow>=9.5.0,<11.0.0

# OPTION 1: Current Whisper (already optimized to use 'tiny' model)
openai-whisper>=20231117

# OPTION 2: Faster Whisper (3-4x faster - RECOMMENDED for production)
# Uncomment this and comment out openai-whisper above to use faster implementation:
# faster-whisper>=0.10.0

noisereduce>=3.0.0

# PERFORMANCE NOTES:
# 1. Current setup now uses Whisper 'tiny' model (10x faster than 'base')
# 2. For even better performance, switch to faster-whisper (requires code changes)
# 3. Frame interval increased from 10s to 15s (30% fewer frames to process)
# 4. Logging reduced to WARNING level (less I/O overhead)
# 5. Cloud Run resources increased: 8 CPU, 16Gi RAM, 1800s timeout

| **Alias Name**       | 20%    | "Roaring tiger" detected                  | Cannot submit  |
| **Eval Mode**        | 20%    | "Eval Mode: Native Audio Output" detected | Cannot submit  |
| **Language Fluency** | 20%    | Target language match with transcription  | Cannot submit  |
| **Voice Audibility** | 20%    | Exactly 2 audible voices detected         | Cannot submit  |
